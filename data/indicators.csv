Although the income has increased in the NZ by 27.91% compared to 2007, it is has not been sufficient for the households in order to reach income above the poverty line in 2011, which had a substantial increment due to the price of the household shopping basket and the current economic crisis in El Salvador.

As it is stated in the Macroeconomic Study of the Northern Zone, remittances are an important part of the households income in the NZ,(40.3% of the Northern Zone received remittances on 2011) and previous studies indicate that the higher quantity of remittances in the NZ is due to the higher migration trends from localities of this particular region from El Salvador, as a result of this phenomena the deviation greater than 10% of target is explained.
Aditionally NZ Multipurpose Households Survey for 2011 reflects that annual per capita income has increased compared to the previous year $1,099. The annual per capita income of the NZ population in 2011 is: $1,345.
